## About

ZincBindDB is a database of Zinc Binding Sites. It was made as part of my PhD, and is still maintained by me.

Together with ZincBindPredict (machine learning prediction of zinc binding using the data here) and ZincBindWeb (the website frontend) it comprises one of the three components of the overall ZincBind resource.
