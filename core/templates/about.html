    <h1>About the Database</h1>

    <div class="about-box">
        <p>ZincBind is a database of zinc binding site structures, automatically
        generated from the <a href="https://rcsb.org/" target="_blank">Protein
        Data Bank</a>.</p>

        <p>For every PDB structure which contains at least one zinc atom,
        ZincBind identifies the liganding residues and creates a binding site
        for the zinc - with liganding residues defined as those with a nitrogen,
        oxygen or sulphur atom within 3 Angstroms of the zinc.</p>

        <p>If two zinc atoms share a liganding residue, or if a zinc atom shares
        a liganding residue with some other metal ion, these are clustered
        together into a single multi-metal site.</p>

        <p>The chains associated with each zinc site are stored, and clustered
        on 90% sequence identity. These clusters are then used to cluster the
        Zinc Sites themselves - where two sites belong to the same cluster if
        they are associated with the same chain cluster(s) and have the same
        binding residue identifiers.</p>
